# ARSW - Laboratory 3 - Relic Rush
## Thread Safety, Coordination and Deadlock Prevention - Java 21

**Course:** Arquitecturas de Software - ARSW  
**Period:** 2026-2  
**Technology:** Java 21 - Maven - JUnit 5  
**Suggested work mode:** teams of 2-3 students  
**Development time:** one week

## 1. Purpose

In Laboratory 1 you measured the effect of concurrency. In Laboratory 2 you worked with race conditions and minimum critical regions. Laboratory 3 goes one step further:

> **How do we coordinate many threads, build thread-safe shared abstractions, detect deadlocks and prevent them without destroying concurrency?**

The focus is not simply to make the program "stop failing". You must explain the invariants, identify the coordination mechanism that each problem needs, and justify the trade-offs of the final design.

---

# 2. Game: Relic Rush

Relic Rush is a small concurrent game. Several adventurers compete to craft as many relics as possible.

Each adventurer is represented by a **platform thread**. During every round it must obtain **two exclusive forge stations** before it can craft a relic.

Examples of stations:

- Arcane Anvil
- Crystal Lens
- Rune Press
- Dragon Furnace
- Moon Altar
- Obsidian Table

When an adventurer gets both stations:

1. it crafts one relic;
2. its personal score increases;
3. a global event is registered in the `ForgeLedger`.

All adventurers play concurrently.

---

# 3. What is intentionally wrong in the starter?

The project contains concurrency defects on purpose.

You should expect to find at least these categories:

1. **Unsafe shared state** in the global ledger.
2. **A non-atomic read-modify-write operation**.
3. **A non-thread-safe collection** receiving concurrent writes.
4. **Nested lock acquisition in inconsistent order**, which can create deadlock.

The round coordination using `CyclicBarrier` is intentionally provided as a correct reference mechanism. Analyze it before modifying other parts.

---

# 4. Rules of the game and invariants

At the end of a completed round, the following values should agree:

```text
sum of all player scores
        ==
ForgeLedger.totalCrafted
        ==
number of ForgeEvent entries
```

Therefore, an important invariant is:

> **Every successfully crafted relic must be reflected exactly once in the player scores and exactly once in the global ledger.**

A second invariant is related to exclusive resources:

> **A forge station cannot be used simultaneously by two incompatible craft operations.**

Your solution must preserve these invariants without making the whole game sequential.

# 5. Requirements

- JDK 21
- Maven 3.9+
- Git

Verify:

```bash
java -version
mvn -version
```

---

# 6. Build

```bash
mvn clean test
```

If you only want to run the compiled classes:

```bash
mvn -q -DskipTests package
```

---

# 7. Run the game

Default configuration:

```bash
java -cp target/classes edu.eci.arsw.relicrush.app.RelicRushMain
```

Custom configuration:

```bash
java -cp target/classes edu.eci.arsw.relicrush.app.RelicRushMain <players> <stations> <rounds>
```

Example:

```bash
java -cp target/classes edu.eci.arsw.relicrush.app.RelicRushMain 16 6 50
```

A round snapshot looks like:

```text
ROUND 07 | scoreSum=56 | ledger=54 | events=55 | invariant=BROKEN
```

Do not assume that one correct run proves thread safety.

---

# 8. Part I - Understand the coordination model

Before changing code, study:

- `GameEngine`
- `Adventurer`
- `roundStart`
- `roundEnd`

The game uses two `CyclicBarrier` instances.

### Scenario A - Start gate

All workers wait until the coordinator releases the round.

### Scenario B - Round completion

The coordinator waits until every worker finishes its turn before reading the scoreboard.

Answer in `docs/REPORT_TEMPLATE.md`:

1. What problem does `roundStart` solve?
2. What problem does `roundEnd` solve?
3. Why would `Thread.sleep(...)` be an incorrect coordination strategy here?
4. What memory-consistency benefit do you obtain by reading the snapshot after the barrier?

---

# 9. Part II - Make the shared ledger thread-safe

Study `ForgeLedger`.

The starter currently contains:

- a shared integer updated with a read-modify-write sequence;
- an `ArrayList` modified concurrently.

Run the isolated ledger probe first:

```bash
java -cp target/classes edu.eci.arsw.relicrush.app.LedgerRaceProbe
java -cp target/classes edu.eci.arsw.relicrush.app.LedgerRaceProbe 64 5000
```

This lets you study the shared-state problem independently from the deadlock exercise.

Your task:

1. Reproduce an invariant violation.
2. Identify the exact shared state.
3. Select appropriate Java concurrency mechanisms.
4. Make the ledger thread-safe.
5. Explain why your solution is preferable to synchronizing the entire game.

Possible tools you may evaluate:

- `AtomicInteger`
- concurrent collections
- `synchronized`
- explicit locks

You are expected to choose, not blindly use all of them.

---

# 10. Part III - Reproduce and diagnose the deadlock

Run:

```bash
java -cp target/classes edu.eci.arsw.relicrush.app.DeadlockProbe
```

With the starter implementation, you should be able to obtain a result similar to:

```text
DEADLOCK DETECTED
- probe-A-anvil-then-furnace waiting on ... owned by probe-B-furnace-then-anvil
- probe-B-furnace-then-anvil waiting on ... owned by probe-A-anvil-then-furnace
```

If a deadlock is difficult to reproduce, execute the probe several times.

### Optional operating-system diagnosis

Find the Java process:

```bash
jps -l
```

Then inspect its threads:

```bash
jcmd <PID> Thread.print
```

or, when available:

```bash
jstack <PID>
```

Document evidence of the wait cycle.

---

# 11. Part IV - Explain the four deadlock conditions

Map the four Coffman conditions to the game:

1. **Mutual exclusion**
2. **Hold and wait**
3. **No preemption**
4. **Circular wait**

Your report must explain exactly where each one appears in the code.

---

# 12. Part V - Prevent the deadlock

Study:

```text
edu.eci.arsw.relicrush.concurrency.LockPair
```

The starter acquires two station monitors in the order requested by the player.

Your solution must prevent deadlocks **without using one global lock for every craft operation**.

Recommended direction:

> Define a deterministic global ordering for forge stations and always acquire locks in that order.

You may propose a different strategy if you can justify it technically.

After the fix:

```bash
java -cp target/classes edu.eci.arsw.relicrush.app.DeadlockProbe
```

Expected outcome:

```text
NO DEADLOCK DETECTED within 2 seconds.
```

---

# 13. Part VI - Stress verification

After fixing both thread safety and deadlocks, execute at least:

```bash
java -cp target/classes edu.eci.arsw.relicrush.app.InvariantProbe 8 6 50
java -cp target/classes edu.eci.arsw.relicrush.app.InvariantProbe 32 8 100
java -cp target/classes edu.eci.arsw.relicrush.app.InvariantProbe 128 8 100
```

For every completed round:

```text
invariant=OK
```

The game must finish normally.

---

# 14. Architectural analysis

The final report must connect the implementation with quality attributes.

Discuss at least:

### Correctness / reliability

- Which invariants are protected?
- What evidence demonstrates that they hold?

### Performance / throughput

- Where can lock contention appear?
- Why is a global lock undesirable?
- Which craft operations can still execute concurrently?

### Maintainability

- Is lock ownership obvious?
- Is the lock ordering rule explicit and easy to preserve?

### Scalability

- What happens when the number of players grows while the number of stations stays constant?

---

# 15. Mini ADR

Create:

```text
docs/ADR-001-deadlock-prevention.md
```

Use this structure:

```markdown
# ADR-001: Deadlock prevention strategy

## Context
## Decision
## Alternatives considered
## Quality attributes affected
## Evidence
## Consequences
## Risks
```

---

# 16. Restrictions

- Java 21 only.
- Do not remove concurrency.
- Do not convert the game into sequential execution.
- Do not solve the whole game with one global lock.
- Do not delete the barriers to hide synchronization problems.
- Do not use arbitrary sleeps as a coordination mechanism.
- Do not replace the required reasoning with only screenshots.
- The final solution must pass repeated stress executions.

This lab deliberately uses **platform threads** instead of revisiting virtual threads. Virtual threads were already explored earlier in the course; here the learning objective is coordination, thread safety and deadlock behavior.

---

# 17. Deliverables

Your repository must include:

```text
README.md
pom.xml
src/
docs/REPORT.md
docs/ADR-001-deadlock-prevention.md
```

Use `docs/REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` as the starting point for `REPORT.md`.

coordination
    -> thread-safe state
    -> invariant

The objective is not merely to know `synchronized`.

> **The objective is to design a concurrent solution whose correctness and liveness can be explained and demonstrated.**
